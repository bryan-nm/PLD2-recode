"""Fold FASTA files with ESMFold in a process that does NOTHING else, and survive crashes.

WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE PROCESS (inherited from ProLoopDiff, where it was established the hard way).
Folding on Aurora dies with "Segmentation fault from GPU ... NotPresent" at a rate that survived
four hypotheses and four refutations: oneCCL (a 1-rank run with no process group crashed
identically), sequence content (scrambled naturals fold fine), unpatched aten XPU->CPU fallbacks
(PYTORCH_DEBUG_XPU_FALLBACK printed nothing beyond det/svd), and memory pressure (14.2 GiB peak of
64 GiB, flat, when it died on the FIRST row). So this stops trying to prevent the crash and makes it
cost almost nothing:

  * SEPARATION. Generation and folding never share a process, so ESMFold's 12.4 GiB and its
    process-global monkey-patches (torch.linalg.svd/det, F.linear/F.layer_norm) never coexist with
    the ipex-optimised trainer. Whatever the interaction is, there isn't one to have.

  * RESUMABILITY. Every scored sequence is appended to a JSONL and fsynced immediately, and a rerun
    skips ids already present. A crash 60 sequences into 100 costs 40, not 100 -- which turns a
    fatal bug into a slow one. scripts/fold.pbs just relaunches until it exits clean.

Scoring is one sequence per score() call rather than handing the whole list over, purely so a crash
cannot take unrecorded work with it. The scorer loops internally anyway, so it costs nothing.

PLD2 adds --watch: poll SAMPLES_DIR for FASTAs the trainer drops every eval_every steps and fold
each as it appears, so the structural metric tracks training live instead of being a post-hoc pass.
The summary groups by step (all ranks of one step are one row) and reports the long-range k-mer
repetition statistic next to pLDDT/pTM -- the two numbers that together say whether the model is
producing foldable, non-degenerate sequences.

MULTI-RANK. Folding is one sequence at a time, so per-rank parallelism is the only parallelism
available, and a whole eval node was running on one of its twelve tiles. This now runs N independent
processes, each pinned to its own tile, splitting `todo` by a deterministic stride. It NEVER calls
init_process_group -- dist.init_distributed(no_dist=True) reads the MPI topology and pins the device
but stops short of oneCCL -- because oneCCL's node-local Level-Zero IPC peer mappings are what made
multi-rank folding fault on Aurora (12 ranks WITH a process group died 3 for 3, always reading an
unmapped page in the 0xff03ffff... IPC range, while 1 rank with no process group folded cleanly).
Each rank appends to its OWN <out>.rankNNN.jsonl rather than sharing one file: concurrent appends to
a single file on Lustre can interleave mid-line, and per-rank files cost nothing since every reader
here already globs.

THE RESUME KEY IS (id, sequence), NOT id. An id is "<file stem>|<fasta header>", which is derived
entirely from POSITION -- so regenerating natural.fasta with completely different sequences produces
the identical ids natural|natural_0 .. natural|natural_199, and the stale records silently suppress
every one of the new ones. Observed exactly that after the holdout fix changed which sequences the
baselines draw: "400 already scored | 0 to do" for a pair of files whose contents had entirely
changed. Keying on content as well means a re-scored id is re-folded, while an unchanged rerun still
skips instantly.
