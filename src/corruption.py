"""The PLD2 corruption process: ONE diffusion with MASK as an absorbing state.

Replaces the earlier two-process design (a pure-OADM branch and a pure-substitution D3PM branch on
disjoint rows). That design reproduced EvoDiff's D3PM exactly -- including the property that makes
it lose: its transition matrix was doubly stochastic over an alphabet WITHOUT a mask state, so its
stationary distribution was uniform over amino acids and generation would have to cold-start from
uniform-random residues. No "this position is definitely unknown" signal, no implicit known-count
signal, and no shared entry point with the OADM branch.

Here there is one process. Per step, a non-MASK position either

    stays          with probability 1 - c_t
    -> MASK        with probability beta * c_t          (absorbing)
    -> substitute  with probability (1 - beta) * c_t    (BLOSUM-weighted, zero diagonal)

and MASK is absorbing: Q_t[MASK, MASK] = 1. So beta is literally "of the corruption events that
happen, what fraction are maskings", which is what makes it the OADM <-> substitution slider:

    beta = 1     no substitution channel at all -> the corruption IS OADM's
    beta -> 0    substitution dominates, but masking still proceeds on its own schedule

Because MASK is absorbing and reachable from every state at any beta > 0, the stationary
distribution is all-MASK for the WHOLE family. That is the point:

  * generation always cold-starts from a fully-masked canvas (OADM's clean entry point), at every
    beta -- so beta does not change what the sampler starts from;
  * the "how many positions are known" signal that makes OADM scale is preserved;
  * L_T is genuinely ~0 rather than dropped on credit (measured below via mask_fraction);
  * and the substitution channel is enriched into the SAME trajectories, so the model learns
    token->token repair as part of one objective rather than as a bolt-on.

THE SCHEDULE IS CLOSED-FORM, NOT CALIBRATED. The absorbing channel's cumulative mask fraction is
pinned to the linear target t/T, which is what makes beta=1 exactly the absorbing-state form of
OADM's n ~ U(1, D) masking. Survival through step t is prod(1 - beta*c_s), so setting
beta*c_t = 1/(T - t + 1) gives prod = (T-t)/T, i.e. mask fraction exactly t/T. Hence

    c_t = min(1, 1 / (beta * (T - t + 1)))

The clamp only binds over the last ceil(1/beta) steps, where the survival probability is already
~1e-3, so the mask fraction still reaches ~1 at T (mask_fraction() reports the achieved curve).
The previous file's numerical Sinkhorn/bisection calibration is gone with the uniform-stationary
requirement that motivated it.

THE TWO CHANNELS FACTOR, which is worth knowing because it makes the whole thing verifiable. Write
the non-MASK block of Q_t as P_t; then P_t = (1 - beta*c_t) * M_t with M_t row-stochastic, so

    Qbar_t[i, MASK] = 1 - survival_t          (the same for every i)
    Qbar_t[i, j]    = survival_t * Mbar_t[i, j]

Everything below builds Qbar by honest matrix products and the self-test checks it against that
factorisation.

SPAN CORRUPTION (`span_width`) SHAPES THE MASK, NOT ITS AMOUNT. Two runs -- 55M/50k and 1.35B/18k --
produced generations whose pTM sat at the shuffled baseline (0.184 and 0.176 vs a shuffle's 0.169,
against 0.677 for naturals), and the held-out CE curve was nearly flat below 50% corruption: going
from 40% of the sequence visible to 95% visible bought 0.18 nats. Under i.i.d. per-position masking
that is what you would predict. At 40% corruption the expected distance from a masked position to
its nearest VISIBLE neighbour is under two residues, so local context is already saturated there and
every further reveal is long-range information the gradient never has to use. The model duly learned
a local infiller -- competent (ppl 7.6 at 5% corruption, in the range published protein MLMs report)
and unable to place a fold.

Span corruption removes the near neighbours. The mask indicator is drawn as a spatially correlated
field instead of independent coin flips, so masked positions arrive in RUNS: to fill the middle of a
64-residue hole the model has to reach past it. The amount of corruption is untouched.

`span_width` IS THE TARGET MEAN MASKED-RUN LENGTH IN RESIDUES at 50% corruption, not an opaque
kernel size -- the field is smoothed with sigma = span_width / 4.44 (the mean zero-crossing interval
of a Gaussian-smoothed Gaussian field) and run_length() reports what was actually achieved:

    span_width  |    1        8       32      128        <- requested
    measured    |  2.0      7.9     28.2     82.6        <- mean masked run at 50% corruption
    nearest visible residue from a masked position, at 50% corruption:
      mean      |  1.3      3.7     12.7     39.6
      median    |  1.0      3.0      9.0     30.0

That first column is the diagnosis restated as a number: under i.i.d. masking the median masked
position has a revealed residue DIRECTLY ADJACENT to it. 128 undershoots its target because a 512
canvas at 50% corruption cannot hold many 128-residue runs; that is a real constraint, not a bug.

`span_width` is a TUPLE assigned per row, for the same reason `betas` is. Keeping w=1 in the mix is
not conservatism: mid-decode the sampler's canvas is a SCATTERED set of confidence-committed
positions among masks, which is the i.i.d. regime, so a model trained only on wide spans would be
off-distribution exactly where it is used. The mixture covers both.

WHAT THIS COSTS, STATED PLAINLY: the exact ELBO. D3PM's q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0) factorises over positions
only because the forward corruption does, and a correlated field does not. Two things survive and
one does not:

  * PER-POSITION MARGINALS ARE EXACT. P(x_t = MASK | x_0) is still exactly Qbar_t[x_0, MASK] at every
    position (see _span_field: a stationary field plus a rank threshold with randomised rounding
    gives the marginal for free). So L_ce -- a per-position cross-entropy -- is unchanged, and the
    stationary distribution, the cold start, and the CE curve stay directly comparable to both
    previous runs.
  * L_vb BECOMES A MEAN-FIELD SURROGATE. We still sum per-position KLs between the true per-position
    posterior marginals and the model's factorised reverse. That is a sensible denoising objective
    and it is the same computation as before, but it is no longer a bound on -log p(x_0): the true
    joint posterior now has cross-position correlation that neither side represents. Reported vb
    numbers remain comparable ACROSS span-corruption runs and should not be read as an ELBO.
  * THE SAMPLER IS UNAFFECTED. It runs the model's reverse process, which is factorised by
    construction either way; nothing in src/sampler.py needs to know about this.

The two channels are split apart to do it, which the factorisation above makes exact: the mask event
is Bernoulli(1 - survival_t) INDEPENDENT of x_0 (the mask column is constant across rows), so it can
be drawn as a correlated field, and the residue outcome is then drawn from Qbar_t's non-MASK block
renormalised. Substitutions stay i.i.d.: a substituted position leaves a token visible, so it is not
a hole in context and it is not what the locality argument is about.

# Mean zero-crossing interval of a Gaussian-smoothed Gaussian field is pi*sqrt(2)*sigma, so this

# theory: width 8 -> 7.9, width 32 -> 28.2. Large widths undershoot (128 -> 83) because a 512 canvas
# at 50% corruption cannot hold many 128-residue runs; run_length() reports the achieved figure.

    width <= 1 is the identity, i.e. independent coin flips.

    GAUSSIAN, NOT A BOX FILTER. A box filter is the obvious choice and it is the wrong one: its
    frequency response is a sinc, so the smoothed field keeps enough high-frequency content to
    fragment its own level sets. Measured at box width 128 on a 512 canvas at 50% corruption, the
    median masked run was 3 positions and 29% of runs were a SINGLE position -- i.i.d. masking with
    a few blobs on top, which is precisely the thing this is meant to stop doing. The Gaussian has
    no sidelobes: at the same mean run length, 1-2% of runs are single positions and the median run
    is 47.

    CIRCULAR, NOT ZERO-PADDED. Zero padding shrinks the variance near the ends, so those positions
    would be masked at a systematically different rate -- measured at 0.257 against a target of 0.300
    over the first 8 positions, which would have quietly under-corrupted every N-terminus. Circular
    wrapping keeps the field stationary, which is the property the rank threshold needs to give an
    exact marginal.
