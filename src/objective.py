"""PLD2 training objective: ONE process, ONE ELBO, beta as the slider.

This replaces a two-branch design (pure-OADM rows scored by a reweighted cross-entropy, pure-
substitution D3PM rows scored by a KL-ELBO). That design had the two frameworks as disjoint
alternatives, and its D3PM half reproduced EvoDiff's uniform-stationary chain -- which cold-starts
from uniform-random residues, has no "this position is unknown" signal, and is the configuration
that loses to OADM. Blending them at generation time then needed a bolted-on second channel with
its own schedule.

Now there is one corruption process with MASK as an absorbing state (see src/corruption.py), and
beta is a parameter OF that process: the fraction of corruption events that are maskings rather
than BLOSUM-weighted substitutions. beta=1 is exactly OADM's corruption; beta<1 enriches the same
trajectories with substitution moves. Every beta shares the all-MASK stationary distribution, so
every beta shares OADM's cold-start entry point.

    L = L_vb + ce_weight * L_ce

  L_vb   T * E_t KL( q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0) || p_theta(x_{t-1}|x_t) ) -- the D3PM variational bound over
         the unified Q. It covers BOTH move types in one term (unmasking an absorbed position and
         substituting a placed one), and at t=1 reduces to L_0 = -log p_theta(x_0|x_1) with no
         special case (Qbar_0 = I). L_T is dropped, and here that is free rather than an
         approximation: P(x_T = MASK) measures 0.999-1.000 at every beta.

         THE FACTOR OF T IS NOT COSMETIC. L_vb is a SUM over t = 1..T; sampling one t ~ U(1,T) and
         taking the KL estimates the MEAN, so the unbiased estimator of the sum multiplies by T.
         The first PLD2 run omitted it and the consequence was severe: the reported vb sat at 0.005
         against a ce of ~1.3, so the variational term -- the entire reason this is a diffusion
         model rather than a masked LM -- contributed 0.4% of the gradient and the run was, in
         effect, trained on the auxiliary cross-entropy alone. At T=500 the scaled term lands near
         2.5, comparable to L_ce, which is what the ELBO says it should be.

  L_ce   -log p~_theta(x_0 | x_t) over the CORRUPTED positions, EvoDiff's lambda term. They set
         lambda=0; PLD2 keeps it at 1 because at beta=1 it IS the OADM cross-entropy, so the
         objective that demonstrably works stays present as a component.

         SCORED ON CORRUPTED POSITIONS ONLY, which the first run did not do. Mask fraction is
         U(0,1), so about half of every row is a position whose answer is VISIBLE in the input --
         a copy, solved within the first few hundred steps, and worth no gradient thereafter.
         Scoring it spent roughly half the objective's weight on nothing and made the reported
         number uninterpretable (it mixes ~0-cost copies with real predictions, which is why
         estimating the true masked-position CE from the log took three assumptions). A position
         counts as corrupted when x_t != x_0, which is exactly "the model cannot copy the answer":
         MASK always qualifies, and a substitution that happened to land on the original token
         correctly does not. `ce_uncorrupted_weight` restores the old behaviour at 1.0.

         Note the "keep this token" signal is not lost by restricting L_ce -- it lives in L_vb,
         whose posterior at an uncorrupted position is peaked on the current token and which the
         factor of T now makes count.

A DISTRIBUTION OVER BETA IS NOW COHERENT, and is the default. Under the old design mixing beta
would have blurred two different bounds together -- the mistake ProLoopDiff made. Here beta only
selects which transition matrix a row is corrupted by, and one ELBO scores them all, so drawing a
different beta per row is just training over a family of corruption processes. Rows are assigned
round-robin (`arange(B) % n_beta`) rather than randomly: the batch order is already shuffled, so
that is unbiased, and it makes the mix exactly balanced every step instead of only in expectation.

SPAN CORRUPTION CHANGES WHAT L_vb IS, and the change is worth stating where the loss is defined
rather than only where the corruption is. With `span_width` beyond (1,) the forward process no
longer factorises over positions, so the sum of per-position KLs computed below is a MEAN-FIELD
SURROGATE for the ELBO, not the ELBO: the true joint posterior carries cross-position correlation
that neither q_post nor p_post represents. The computation is unchanged and remains a sensible
denoising objective -- and L_ce, being a per-position cross-entropy against exact per-position
marginals, is unaffected either way -- but a `vb` figure from a span run is not a bound on
-log p(x_0) and should only be compared to other span runs. src/corruption.py's docstring has the
full accounting of what survives.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POSITION WEIGHTS (upweight EOS).

A fixed 512 canvas holds about 350 residues, 160 PAD and exactly ONE EOS. Unweighted, the token that
decides sequence LENGTH carries 1/512 = 0.2% of the loss, and ProLoopDiff duly learned everything
except where to stop: at 181k steps, 53% of unconditional samples never placed EOS at all. At
eos_loss_weight=20 against pad_loss_weight=0.1 the split is roughly 350 : 16 : 20, i.e. EOS is ~5%
of the per-sequence loss -- ~25x its unweighted share, and still far from dominating.

    WHY A SURROGATE AT ALL. An any-order model can produce y from x by any of L! decoding paths, so
    the exact log pi(y|x) is a sum over all of them and is not computable. ESM3 hit the same wall
    (Appendix A.4.1) and used the same substitute: mask y on a noise schedule, prompt the model with
    what is left, and take the cross-entropy at the masked positions --

        log pi(y|x) ~= E_m [ sum_{i in m} log p(y_i | y_\\m, x) ]

    which mirrors pretraining exactly, and at the pure-masking end of our beta slider is the same
    quantity the ARDM identity makes equal to the generative NLL. That is why the surrogate masks
    rather than substitutes: beta = 1 is the setting where this number means something.

    THE SAME MASK FOR WINNER AND LOSER, AND FOR POLICY AND REFERENCE. All four log-likelihoods in
    the IPO/DPO term are estimates of an expectation over masks, and their DIFFERENCES are what the
    loss uses. Sharing the draw cancels the estimation noise at first order instead of accumulating
    it four times. ESM3 says the same in one line; it is close to free and it is not optional at
    these margins.

    Our pairs make this exact rather than approximate, which ESM3's could not be: a prompt owns its
    length (src/prompts.py), so both completions of a pair are the same length and the mask is
    literally identical rather than merely identically distributed.

    ONLY GENERATED POSITIONS ARE SCORED. The prompt is x, not y. Masking revealed scaffold would
    score the model on reproducing context it was handed, which every candidate does equally well
    and which therefore only adds variance.

    `rate` defaults to a draw from U(0,1) -- ESM3's linear schedule -- so a pair is seen at a

    A MEAN, NOT A SUM, which makes the IPO target margin a per-token nat budget -- length-invariant,

    for the same reason and leaves the contrastive one unnormalised; normalising both keeps the two
