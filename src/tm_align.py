"""TM-score every generated structure against the query its prompt was carved from.

    mpiexec -n 12 python -m src.tm_align --pdb-dir <round>/pdb

THIS IS THE PROMPT-CONSISTENCY HALF OF THE REWARD, and the half that makes the other half safe to
optimise. pLDDT alone says "this folds into something confident", which a poly-alanine helix
satisfies; TM to the query says "it folds into the RIGHT something", which it does not. Pairs built
on pLDDT alone would have a degenerate optimum sitting directly on the reward's frontier -- and we
have measured the model's density already leaning that way, since best-of-N by its own
log-likelihood is worse than a random draw. TM closes that door.

It is also the direct analogue of the cRMSD term ESM3 aligned against (Appendix A.4.3). Their
prompts were backbone coordinates, so consistency was RMSD to the prompted atoms; ours are partial
scaffolds carved out of a natural protein, so consistency is TM to that protein. Both ask the same
question: did the completion respect the structure it was handed?

ONE PREDICTOR, END TO END. The target is the reference PDB that src/reference_set.py folded --
the same structure the prompt's 3Di scaffold was read off. So the scaffold the model is handed and
the structure it is graded against come from one fold of one protein by one predictor. Mixing them
(an AlphaFold-derived scaffold against an ESMFold target, which is what carving prompts out of the
AFDB shards would give) puts a predictor disagreement inside the reward, and that disagreement is
not a constant offset: it is largest exactly where prediction is hardest, which is where the
interesting samples are.

ONE FOLDSEEK INVOCATION PER CHUNK OF PROMPTS, not per prompt. Startup dominates a small alignment
job, so prompts are batched: a chunk's generations are the query set, that chunk's natural proteins
are the target set, --exhaustive-search forces every pair to be aligned rather than prefiltered, and
rows are then kept only where the target is the generation's OWN query. Work per rank is constant in
the number of nodes -- 16 nodes and 200 nodes both give a rank a few dozen prompts -- so this scales
by doing nothing that depends on the world size.

RESUMABLE per chunk, per rank, appended and fsynced, like every other pass in this pipeline.
