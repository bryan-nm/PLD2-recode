"""BLOSUM62 -> the two matrices the corruption processes need.

Two different objects come out of the same file, for two different jobs:

  * blosum_sub_probs()  -- a 20x20 ROW-STOCHASTIC matrix with a zero diagonal: "if residue i is
    corrupted, what does it become". Used by the sampler's substitution corrector.

  * substitution_kernel() -- an n x n ROW-STOCHASTIC kernel with a ZERO DIAGONAL over the non-MASK
    alphabet (20 AA + EOS + PAD): "given that this position is being substituted, what does it
    become". This is the B in corruption.CorruptionSchedule, and it is what PLD2 uses.

  * blosum_transition() -- a doubly-stochastic variant, kept for reference. Double stochasticity
    made UNIFORM the stationary distribution of a mask-free chain; PLD2's chain has MASK as an
    absorbing state, so its stationary distribution is all-MASK regardless of the kernel and the
    Sinkhorn step is no longer needed.

Alphabet order: our canonical AA string (== token id), NOT BLOSUM column order
(A R N D C Q E G H I L K M F P S T W Y V B Z X J O U -), so the file is reordered on load.

EvoDiff includes uniform rows for the non-standard codes and <GAP>; the analogue here is EOS and
PAD, which get a BLOSUM score of 0 against everything (0 = "as often as chance", BLOSUM's neutral
point) before the exponentiation and Sinkhorn. That keeps every entry strictly positive, which is
what Sinkhorn-Knopp needs to converge.
