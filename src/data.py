"""Data pipeline: pre-tokenised UniRef shards -> fixed-512-canvas batches.

Much smaller than ProLoopDiff's because PLD2 has one corpus and one shape:

  * ONE corpus. No SwissProt, no captions, no text embedder, no mixed/oversampled index -- PLD2 is
    unconditional and trains on the size-filtered UniRef shards only (instruction 5).

  * ONE canvas width, fixed at 512 (instruction 7). ProLoopDiff needed length buckets to keep the
    PAD tail short across variable widths; with a single fixed width there is nothing to bucket, so
    BucketedLengthSampler is gone. Every batch is exactly (B, 512) and B is constant, which is the
    static-shape property XPU wants anyway.

  * STATELESS, RESUMABLE SHUFFLING. StepBatchSampler derives each rank's batch from (seed, step,
    rank) alone -- there is no epoch counter and no giant permutation array. A run resumed at step S
    therefore draws EXACTLY the batches the original run would have, which ProLoopDiff's
    epoch-seeded permutation did not (its repro.py documents resumed jobs walking a batch sequence
    the original never saw). It also avoids materialising a ~1.2GB permutation of a 150M-row corpus
    on every rank.

  * HELD-OUT SPLIT. The LAST shard file is reserved: ProteinShards(split="train") skips it and
    split="holdout" reads only it. src/make_baselines.py draws the natural/shuffled fold references
    from the holdout, so the reference sequences a checkpoint is compared against are ones the model
    was never trained on. ProLoopDiff had no held-out split at all.

    At ~100M+ sequences we must NOT build a per-sequence Python index. Only the per-shard offset
    arrays and a cumulative count are kept, and item i is located by searchsorted over the shards.

    THE TRAIN/HOLDOUT SPLIT IS STRIDED, NOT BY SHARD, and that correction matters. An earlier version
    reserved the LAST SHARD as the holdout, which is only unbiased if the corpus order is unbiased --
    an assumption there was never any basis for. Shard order is FASTA order, and a length-sorted
    FASTA (many distributions ship that way) puts the extreme tail of the length distribution in the
    last shard. Observed on the real UniRef shards: a 200-sequence "natural" baseline came out at
    33.9 +- 2.3 aa from a corpus filtered to 30-500, i.e. the shortest ~1% of the data, pinned
    against the floor. Nothing in the reader was wrong; the split was.

    Holding out every `holdout_stride`-th sequence GLOBALLY is order-agnostic -- it gives the same
    ~1% sample whatever the FASTA is sorted by -- and both directions of the map are closed-form, so
    the sampler still needs no materialised index:

        holdout   j -> j * S
        train     j -> (j // (S-1)) * S + (j % (S-1)) + 1

    Only whole blocks of S are used, so the map has no edge cases; the trailing N % S sequences
    (< 100 out of ~1e8) belong to neither split.

    but a narrower, shorter sequence distribution -- and it moves the fold table's natural ceiling
    (measured: 73.0 pLDDT / 0.568 pTM at length 165, against UniRef's 81.8 / 0.677 at 250), so the
