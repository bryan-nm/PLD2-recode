"""Unconditional confidence-ordered (MaskGIT-style) decoder.

Start from an all-MASK canvas of width Lmax; each step score every masked position, commit the most
confident few on a cosine schedule, leave the rest for later. Better than EvoDiff's random unmask
order, and it is what makes EOS-based length work: the boundary is committed when the model is
confident about it, not at a fixed position.

Carried over from ProLoopDiff (all of it earned, none of it implicated in the repetition problem):

  * EOS FIRST. `_place_eos_first` samples the boundary from P(EOS at i) over the all-MASK canvas --
    the model's marginal length prior -- and commits it before any residue. Decoding forbids
    emitting PAD, so without this a row that fails to place EOS is forced to invent residues across
    a region that was PAD throughout training, where it has no signal and falls back on copying its
    neighbours. That is where the repetitive tails came from. Deciding the boundary first makes that
    region legitimately PAD.

  * REPETITION PENALTY over periods 1..5 plus a hard max_run cap, in BOTH directions (decoding is
    any-order, so a tract can grow rightward or leftward). It needs n_steps ~= Lmax to bite: the
    penalty scores each position against the canvas BEFORE that step's commits, so co-committed
    positions cannot see one another. Measured on a 128 canvas at max_run=5, the longest homopolymer
    was 42 at 8 commits/step, 26 at 2/step and exactly the cap at 1/step.

  * CORRECTORS. `remask` works with any model; `substitution` resamples low-confidence residues
    directly and pairs with the D3PM half of PLD2's objective, which is what teaches token->token
    denoising. Because EOS is an allowed emission there, a substitution sweep can also MOVE the
    boundary.

Differences from ProLoopDiff: no text, no CFG, no guidance-weight plumbing -- PLD2 is unconditional.
And every per-row Python loop is gone. Each `for b in range(B)` cost a device->host sync, of which a
512-step decode ran thousands; the vectorised rank-threshold form below commits exactly the same
positions with no syncs at all.

`guidance_fn(canvas, logits) -> logits` is untouched and is the ProteinGuide hook: a property model
can reweight the per-position categorical without this file knowing anything about it.

    Confidence ordering commits the most PREDICTABLE positions first, and a repeat is maximally

    Two terms, both reading only COMMITTED residues (MASK/PAD/EOS are never repeat evidence):
      soft -- at position i, subtract `penalty` from the logit of whatever residue sits at i+-p, for
        each period p. Contributions accumulate over p, so a homopolymer (which matches at every
        period) is suppressed hardest and an isolated coincidence barely at all.
      hard -- if placing a residue at i would PRODUCE a run longer than max_run, counting neighbours
        on both sides plus itself, that residue is effectively banned. Checking one side only is not
        enough: a gap between a run of 3 and a run of 2 sees five-in-a-row on neither side, yet
        filling it yields six. A large finite subtraction, not -inf, so no NaN can reach the softmax.

    [AA* EOS PAD*], in every track.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    TWO TRACKS SHARE ONE RANKING, and that is the point of the layout. A 3Di edit and an amino-acid
    edit at the same position are SEPARATE candidates competing on the same confidence scale, so
    the decoder is free to lay down structure first and fill residues into it -- exactly the
    "global plan, then sequence" behaviour a joint (aa, 3Di) token could not express, because
    committing one such token commits both channels at once. Whether that ordering actually emerges
    is an empirical question the decode answers on its own: 3Di is the lower-entropy track
    (H = 2.52 nats against 2.89 for residues), so it should tend to win early slots without being
    told to.

    struct_first  forces the issue if it does not emerge. It is a decaying BIAS on structure
                confidences over the first `struct_first * n_steps` steps, not a gate: every slot
                stays eligible throughout, so the cosine floor and the termination proof below are
                untouched. 0.0 leaves the ranking alone, which is the default and the honest test.

    A caller-supplied guidance_fn is applied AFTER the repetition penalty, so a ProteinGuide-style
    hook composes with it rather than replacing it.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    UNIFIED EDIT DECODING (subst_per_residue > 0)

    The model is trained on ONE process in which a position can be masked or substituted (see
    src/corruption.py), so decoding offers the matching pair of moves and picks between them on one
    confidence scale. Every step, each position proposes exactly one candidate edit:

        masked            -> UNMASK to a drawn token
        committed residue -> SUBSTITUTE to a different token

    both scored by the model's probability for the token being written (see _edit_candidates for why
    substitutions are drawn from a renormalised distribution but SCORED under the original one).
    The highest-confidence edits win. There is no separate corrector pass and no second schedule:
    substitution is a first-class move throughout the decode, which is what the objective trains.

    WHY THE UNMASK QUOTA IS STILL A FLOOR. A single global ranking over both move types can starve
    the mask channel -- if substitution edits keep out-scoring unmask edits, masks are never
    committed and the canvas never resolves. So the cosine schedule's unmask count is taken FIRST
    and guaranteed, and only the remaining budget is allocated by global ranking (where an unmask
    can still win, so the floor never caps progress). That preserves the termination proof exactly:
    the cosine target is 0 at the final step, so everything still masked is committed then.

    WHY THE WORK IS BOUNDED. Both move types are chosen from the SAME forward pass -- the candidate
    tokens and their confidences all come from one call to the model. Nothing iterates to
    convergence. Model forwards are exactly
        1 (eos_first) + n_steps + n_corrector * (2 if remask else 1)
    independent of subst_per_residue, which src/tests_sampler.py asserts.

    subst_per_residue  the substitution budget, as expected edits per decodable position over the
                whole decode. The per-step allowance is `round(k * n_active / n_steps)`, constant,
                so early steps (few committed residues, most of the allowance unusable) spend little
                and late steps spend it all -- the OADM-like -> substitution-rich ramp falls out of
                the canvas filling up rather than needing a schedule. 0.0 disables substitution
                entirely, recovering pure absorbing decoding bit-for-bit.
    stats       optional dict, filled with edit accounting if given.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    PROMPTING (prompt / prompt_mask)

    prompt      (B,K,Lmax) or (B,Lmax) token ids. prompt_mask marks which of them are GIVEN.
    prompt_mask (B,K,Lmax) or (B,Lmax) bool. True = this position is context, not something to
                generate: it is written into the canvas before step 0 and FROZEN -- never unmasked,
                never substituted, never remasked by a corrector.

    The prompt owns the length. A prompted row must supply EOS and the whole PAD tail as given
    positions (src.prompts builds them that way), so eos_first is skipped: the boundary is not a
    decision the model makes when it has been handed a scaffold to complete. That also keeps the
    cosine schedule honest -- n_active counts only what is actually still masked, so a 40%-masked
    prompt spends its whole step budget on the 40% rather than idling over committed context.

    A (B,L) prompt on a two-track model conditions the SEQUENCE track only; pass (B,K,L) to give
    3Di context as well. Positions given in one track and masked in the other are the interesting
    ones -- they are what makes this inverse folding or structure prediction rather than completion.
