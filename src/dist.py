"""Distributed bootstrap for Aurora (Intel XPU + oneCCL).

Mirrors the conventions of mini-embed-filip/src/dist.py: one rank per GPU *tile*

PALS/PMI env, `xccl` backend preferred (falls back to `ccl`). Degrades to a single-rank

    every row of every batch and no param is ever conditionally unused.

    ONE COLLECTIVE PER STEP, and that is deliberate. Every grad goes into a single fp32 buffer
    regardless of its own dtype, and the non-finite flag rides in the buffer's last element rather
    than taking an all-reduce of its own. At 192 ranks over 16 nodes each additional collective is
    another size-dependent algorithm path inside oneCCL, and small-message paths differ from
    large-message ones; a single large fp32 all-reduce is the shape this job is known to sustain.
    Carrying the flag in-band also makes the skip decision unanimous for free -- every rank reads
    the same reduced element -- with no second collective to keep in sync.

    MIXED GRAD DTYPES ARE NORMAL: ipex.optimize(dtype=bfloat16) casts Linear weights to bf16 but
    deliberately leaves norms, gates and other small parameters in fp32. copy_ upcasts on the way
    in and downcasts on the way out. Reducing in fp32 matters on its own -- accumulating 192 bf16
    values loses ~8% of the value to the 8-bit mantissa.

    The buffer is allocated ONCE and reused. Building it per step (the original
    _flatten_dense_tensors version) freed a ~220MB block back to the caching allocator the instant
    the collective was enqueued; oneCCL runs on its own queue, so the allocator could hand that
    block to the next compute kernel while CCL was still reading it -- a use-after-free that
