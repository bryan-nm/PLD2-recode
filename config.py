    """Preference tuning, following ESM3's IRPO (Appendix A.4) with three deliberate departures.

    IPO, NOT DPO, BY DEFAULT. DPO's log-sigmoid is unbounded, so its implicit KL constraint
    collapses when preferences are near-deterministic (Azar et al.) -- and ours are deterministic by
    construction, because pairs are built from a hard metric gap rather than noisy human labels.
    Three things make drift a bigger risk here than it was for ESM3: that determinism, positives
    that are good only relative to their own prompt, and a reward that is a folder's opinion about a
    generated sequence. IPO's squared loss has a finite optimum, so the margin stops growing.
    `loss="dpo"` switches back for comparison; the two differ by four lines.

    RELATIVE, WITHIN-PROMPT THRESHOLDS, NOT ABSOLUTE ONES. ESM3 could demand pTM > 0.8 and
    cRMSD < 1.5A because its base model produced such samples in quantity. Ours clears an absolute
    bar about 1% of the time, so at n_gen=16 only ~11% of prompts would contain a single qualifying
    sample and 89% of the fold budget would be discarded. Ranking within a prompt yields a usable
    pair at every difficulty instead. success_weight is the knob that reintroduces absolute quality
    -- it upweights pairs whose winner clears the bar outright -- and it is 1.0, i.e. OFF.

    THE MARGIN IS PER POSITION. Our surrogate log-likelihood comes out of a weighted row MEAN
    (objective._weighted_row_mean), so the IPO target is a per-token nat budget rather than a
    sequence-level one: length-invariant, and a number that can be reasoned about.
